# Intro

Revature encourages you to get certifications before you go out to client. This file details which certifications you are eligible for, and some of my suggestions in taking preparing for the exams. The following are exams that can be reimbursed:

1) Oracle Certified Associate, Java SE 8 Programmer (OCA)
2) Oracle Certified Professional

# Oracle Certified Associate, Java SE 8 Programmer

This is a certification that doesn't expire for Java. You can read more about it [here](https://education.oracle.com/oracle-certified-associate-java-se-8-programmer/trackp_333)

In order to prepare for the exam, my recommendation is that you first read through the textbook a couple of times and take [these](https://enthuware.com/java-certification-mock-exams/oracle-certified-associate/ocajp-1z0-808) practice tests. Revature will reimburse you for the practice tests.


# Oracle Certified Professional, Java SE 8 Programmer
This is the next level up from the OCA. You can read more about it [here](https://education.oracle.com/oracle-certified-professional-java-se-8-programmer/trackp_357.). You can also get [these](https://enthuware.com/java-certification-mock-exams/oracle-certified-professional/java-se-8-1z0-809) practice tests.


# AWS Solutions Architect - Associate

This is one of the most popular AWS Certifications. It is much harder than the AWS CCP, but it is also much more sought after.

A lot of people also like to take prep courses on Udemy for this exam. AWS also has some free videos regarding the SAA:

- [Exam Readiness](https://www.aws.training/Details/Curriculum?id=20685)

I highly recommend taking some practice tests before taking the real exam (many are available on Udemy for <\$15), or you can schedule a practice version of the exam before taking the real thing.
