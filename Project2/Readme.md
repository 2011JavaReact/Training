# P2
As you get used to making full stack web applications, you find that you are getting more comfortable and confident working with technology. You and a few of your developer coworkers have thought up an interesting concept for a startup. You all conduct a sprint to create the first iteration/Proof of Concept for this idea of yours. The marketing campaign that you all set out to do went surprisingly well. Maybe it actually went a little too well, because now your team all of a sudden has a an eager investor who wants to see your product at the end of your two week sprint. This investor is known to invest in emerging tech startups, so they seem to know their way around technology.

For your second project, get into groups of 4 or 5. You will be creating a full stack application that uses the following technologies and methodologies at a minimum: **Postgres**, **Java**, **Spring**, **Hibernate**, **React**, **HTML/CSS/JS/TS**, **Jenkins/CI Tool**, **AWS**, and **Agile/Scrum Methodologies**. Feel free to branch out and use other technologies in addition to the ones listed. The quality of your project is a reflection of your skills and abilities, so I recommend that you create something you can be proud of. That being said, this time around, it is arguably more important that the investor is happy with what you have, so remember to talk up your product and give a good presentation. When you pitch to me, make sure you have a description of your project and a product backlog/sprint backlog.

Make sure you pitch your idea to me so that I can approve it. During this project, follow the best practices for the following: *Daily Standup Meetings*, *Sprint Planning Meeting*, *Burndown Chart*, *Scrum Board*, *CI*, *CD*, and *Pull/Merge Requests*. Consider using services such as GitHub, GitLab, Jira, or Trello to manage your Scrum Board.

For this project, there are no real hard requirements. If you do decide to follow any set of guidelines, only do so because you all understand the value of that guideline and appreciate how it helps you build a better, more secure, sustainable, and maintainable project. That being said, I am probably going to ask some pretty hard questions after the presentation if I sense any obvious vulnerabilities.

This project is tentatively due around Dec 30th.

# Minimum Requirements:
- [ ] Impress the investor! Make the sale.
