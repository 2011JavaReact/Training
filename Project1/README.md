# P1
Your team lead reported to your manager that your first project worked well and that you are ready to take on a little more responsibility. This time, rather than working on a back end for your own application, you are now tasked with taking another employee's web service and construct a front-end client for it. The idea is to determine your ability to work with other employees as well as give you some practice reading the code written by other developers. You will have two weeks to accomplish this task.

For your second project, break yourselves up into groups of 2 or 3. Each of you will be writing the front end for the other's web service. The developer of each web service will act as the "Product Owner" of the front end that is being developed. Try your best to adhere to the wishes of the other person as you develop the front ends of each other's application. In addition, it will be necessary for you to deploy your web services remotely so that they are accessible outside of your local environment. Do your best to regularly meet with your co-worker so that you are both in sync with the progress being made.

You must use the following technologies to build the front end client: **JavaScript/Typescript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **React** (optional), **Jenkins**, and **AWS**. The quality of your project is a reflection of your skills and abilities, so I recommend that you create something you can be proud of. The goal is to create something that you can be satisfied with.

This project is tentatively due at the end of Week 5 or the beginning of.

## Project 1 Minimum Requirements
- [ ] A front end client that utilizes at least 4 of the routes from your teammates web service (not including authentication endpoints)
- [ ] Front end should be able to successfully query and perform transactions to the DB via the web service
- [ ] Make minor revisions to the API that you wrote (if applicable)
- [ ] Deploy Servlet application to server on AWS EC2
- [ ] Deploy your frontend to AWS as well (many different ways to do this)
- [ ] Create a pipeline using Jenkins that achieves continuous delivery/ continuous deployment
- [ ] Documentation for front end (you can also fix your documentation for your backend if needed)
- [ ] Unit Testing for React Components (3 components tested)
- [ ] Login Functionality
- [ ] Follow basic Scrum/Agile practices: Sprint Planning Meeting, User Stories, Scrum Board, Standup meetings

## Recommended Stretch Goals
- hit one endpoint from an external API (that neither of you wrote)
- make your app aesthetically pleasing
- create a pipeline for you frontend
- assess your application for code quality using Sonar Cloud

## Extra rules
- We will begin by choosing partners/teams starting Monday of week 4.
- You will have until Wednesday (at 11:59 PM) of week 4 to make changes to your API
- 

## Tips
- do your best to follow proper Scrum Methodology. It's not Scrum if you skip any part of it
- get all of your refactoring done early
- try to squeeze in a code review with your partner(s)
- do some paired programming

## Teams
The list of teams can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1um7H1tfHg-Iu-4HSMqQZEE990H6r7_K736KyuPyW-Ss/edit?usp=sharing). Remember to add the url to your frontend and backend repos onto this document. I want the first paragraph in your repo to say where the deployed app can be accessed if applicable.
