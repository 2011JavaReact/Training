You have recently been hired for company called `insert-name-of-company-here`. You were hired because they liked you during your interview and they thought you would be a good fit for the team. However, this does not mean that they are ready to let you loose on code that is actually meant for production quite yet. They decide to give you a small project to start with to get accustomed to working with their technology stack and get a feel for how quickly you can pick up on things. 

For your first project, you are given about two weeks to create a backend web service that will be used to provide data from a database to the client of a web application. The full web application allows users to log in and manage whatever data the application is meant to handle. This time around, you will not be require to create the UI for the website. The frontend will be implemented in the future.

You must use the following technologies: **Java**, **Servlets**, and **PostgreSQL** You can use whichever theme you would like for your project. The quality of your project is a reflection of your skills and abilities, so I recommend that you create something you can be proud of. The goal is to create something that you can be satisfied with

This project is tentatively due in the middle of Week 3.
